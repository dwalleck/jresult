* Test Suite Name - Enumerated String (i.e. "Smoke", "Daily", "Full") **dw: Not part of junit results**
** In the initial phase, we will not attempt to standardize the suite names.  They may be product/team specific
* Execution Date/Time - Date/Time String **dw: Not part of junit results**
* Environment - Enumerated String (i.e. "Staging", "Pre-Production", "Production") **dw: Not part of junit results**
** In the initial phase, we will not attempt to standardize the environment names.  They may be product/team specific
* Execution Duration -  Time String  (The test runner should calculate this number, especially in cases where tests
                                      are being run in parallel and overall duration cannot simply be summed up from the
                                      duration of the individual tests.)
* Test Name - String
* Test Duration - Time String
* Test Result - Enumerated String, One of ["Pass", "Fail", "Skip"] **dw: no way to determine if a test was skipped from the testcase level. Also, should include error, as error != failure**
* Failure Reason - String
** Present only for tests which do not pass.  Otherwise, empty.
** Conveys a concise explanation for the failure or skip.  For example "Assertion x == y failed" or "Skipped due to environment mismatch"
